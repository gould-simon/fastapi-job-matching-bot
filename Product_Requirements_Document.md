### AI Job Matching Architecture

The AI-powered job-matching system will use **text embeddings** to compare CVs and job descriptions. The system will:
1. **Precompute embeddings for all job descriptions** and store them in PostgreSQL.
2. **Compute CV embeddings on upload** and compare them against stored embeddings using a **vector similarity search**.
3. **Use PgVector** for scalable similarity matching.



### Rate Limiting & Abuse Protection

To prevent bot abuse and spam, we will implement:
- **Rate Limits:** Users can make **5 API calls per second** (adjustable).
- **IP Throttling:** Prevents excessive job searches from the same IP.
- **CAPTCHA for Signups:** (Future scope) Adds protection against spam accounts.



### Progressive User Profile Enrichment

The AI bot will gradually enrich user profiles over time by:
1. **Inferring preferences from user interactions** (e.g., past job searches).
2. **Asking contextual follow-up questions** (e.g., "Are you open to remote work?").
3. **Allowing users to update their profile dynamically** via `/update_profile`.
